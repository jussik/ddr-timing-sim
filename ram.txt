ram simulator

components:
timing diagram
custom command input
custom timings
playback with:
- clock w/ frequency or manual stepping (1 and 1/2 clocks as well as "to next event")
- oscilloscope display for clock and command lines
- state machine view
block diagrams for banks, ICs, ranks, channels etc.
sync block diagram highlights with wireframe of DIMM
high level language
set motherboard memory topology, specify multiple DIMMs explicitly
functionality other than read/write

commands:
ACT - activate row (aka page), called form idle/precharged state (max one row can be active per bank)
	Bank - which bank is selected
	Row address - which row to activate
READ/RD/RDA - transfer 8 bits from activated row to bus
	Bank - which bank is selected
	BC - burst chop, only send first 4 bits (bus available to a different bank in 2 cycles rather than 4)
	AP - auto-precharge, automatically precharges the bank (WRA/RDA)
	Column - which column to process in the activated row
WRITE/WR/WRA - write column (1 byte) from bus to activated row
	see READ for parameters
PRE - precharge one bank
	Bank - bank to be precharged
PREA - precharge all banks
REF - refresh
DES - deselect (no-op)

timings:
CL - CAS Latency, sometimes tCAS (exact cycles from READ/WRITE to data transmission)
tRCD - Row-Column (or Command) Delay (min cycles from ACT to READ/WRITE)
tRP - (Row) Precharge (min cycles from PRE to ACT)
tRAS - RAS Active Time (min cycles from ACT to PRE), min tRCD+CL

tRTP - Row to Precharge Delay (min cycles from READ/WRITE to PRE, also used for auto-precharged)
tCCDS - Back-to-Back (B2B) CAS Delay short (min cycles between READ/WRITE and next READ/WRITE), separate banks, min tBurst
tCCDL - Back-to-Back (B2B) CAS Delay long (min cycles between READ/WRITE and next READ/WRITE), same bank, min tBurst
CR - Command rate (min cycles between chip select and command, 1T or 2T)
tBurst - Burst time, always 4 cycles (8 bits, 2 bits per clock)

tRC - Bank Cycle Time, time between consecutive ACT? (guessing)

latencies:
page hit: CL
page empty: tRCD+CL
page miss: tRP+tRCD+CL
